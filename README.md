# CardDeck

A playing card deck plugin for UE4 I made as an exercise.

I wanted to see what algorithms are available for card shuffling but I came accross (an article)[https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/card-shuffling-algorithms-good-and-bad/] that stated that the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm may not be as great as people think. Another (article)[https://blog.codinghorror.com/shuffling/] stated that sorting by a GUID would be good enough so I made one to see what came out.
